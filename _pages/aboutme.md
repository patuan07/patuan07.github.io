Hi! I'm Tuan, a first-year undergraduate studying **Robotics and Machine Intelligence** at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**. I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between software and hardware—whether that's autonomous robots, computer vision applications, or interactive embedded devices.



# What I Do

My work sits at the intersection of **embedded systems**, **machine learning**, and **robotics**. I enjoy tackling challenges that require both algorithmic thinking and hands-on engineering. From training neural networks to designing circuit boards, I'm energized by projects that demand diverse technical skills and creative problem-solving.

## Areas of Interest

**Computer Vision & Machine Learning**

I'm fascinated by how machines can learn to see and interpret the world. My interests span image classification, object detection, and building ML pipelines that work reliably in real-world conditions. I'm particularly drawn to the practical challenges of deployment—handling noisy data, edge cases, and resource constraints that don't exist in textbook examples.

**Autonomous Robotics**

There's something deeply satisfying about watching a robot navigate its environment independently. I'm interested in perception systems and path planning algorithms techniques that enable robots to understand and respond to their surroundings. I work with platforms like ROS2 and enjoy the challenge of translating theoretical algorithms into working robotic systems.

**Embedded Systems & IoT**

I love building intelligent devices from the ground up. Whether it's microcontroller programming, real-time audio processing, or designing communication protocols between boards, I'm drawn to projects where hardware and software must work in tight coordination. There's a unique satisfaction in optimizing code to run on resource-constrained devices while maintaining responsiveness and reliability.


# Beyond Coursework

Outside of classes, I spend time exploring new frameworks and tools, working on personal projects, and staying current with developments in robotics and AI. I'm particularly interested in how recent advances in machine learning can be practically applied to robotic systems and embedded devices.

I enjoy collaborating with others who share similar interests and am always eager to learn from people with different perspectives and skill sets.

# Looking Ahead

As I continue my studies, I'm excited to deepen my knowledge in autonomous systems, computer vision, and embedded AI. I'm particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to work on real-world applications where intelligent systems interact with their environment.
