# Welcome!

You can call me Ben or Tuan (pronounced like "Twan" if you're struggling).

Welcome to my website, where you can learn more about [me](https://patuan07.github.io/aboutme/), explore my projects, view my resume, and get in touch!

## About Me

I'm a first-year undergraduate studying **Robotics and Machine Intelligence** at the **National University of Singapore**. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomous systems, computer vision, and embedded AI—basically, building intelligent machines that can perceive and interact with the real world.

Currently, I'm a **Software Individual Contributor** at **Hornet XI's Software Team**, where we're developing an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. It's an exciting challenge that combines perception systems, path planning, and real-time control in one of the most demanding environments for robotics.

Beyond coursework and team projects, I spend my time building things—whether that's training computer vision models, programming embedded systems, or designing autonomous navigation algorithms. I believe the best way to learn is by making, breaking, and iterating.
